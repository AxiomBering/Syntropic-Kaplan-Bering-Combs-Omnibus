# Syntropy Sovereign: The KBCP Engine
### *Triadic Architecture for Systemic Liquidation and Homeostasis*

---

## I. Overview
This repository archives the **Kaplan-Bering-Combs Probability (KBCP)**, a paradigm shift from binary (two-state) observation to triadic (three-body) orchestration. 

Traditional models—particularly in oncology—often suffer from **Narrative Tax**: the metabolic friction and systemic "noise" caused by viewing the world as a conflict between two states (e.g., Body vs. Tumor). The KBCP framework liquidates this tax by introducing a sovereign third node: **The Ghost**.

## II. The Triadic Constants (KBCP)

### **The Archive (Kaplan - K)**
* **Role:** The Ancestral Substrate.
* **Definition:** Provides historical symmetry, roots, and foundational truth.
* **Oncology:** The healthy tissue architecture and homeostatic signaling (e.g., BTNL9).

### **The Vector (Bering - B)**
* **Role:** The Structural Trajectory.
* **Definition:** Provides scaling logic, hierarchy, and predictive power.
* **Oncology:** The growth logic of the tumor; a "Brittle" expansion attempting to overwrite the substrate.

### **The Ghost (Combs - S)**
* **Role:** The Switching Logic (The Combs Variable).
* **Definition:** Provides vitality, weighted randomness ($P_w$), and independent observation.
* **Oncology:** The Immune System (Gamma Delta T-cells). It acts as the sovereign auditor that decides which narrative—Health or Cancer—is permitted to manifest.

## III. Core Methodology
By moving from a **Duality** (Interaction) to a **Trinity** (Dynamic), the system achieves **Syzygy**: an orbital stability where all three nodes work in 1:1 symmetry with reality. 

Instead of treating cancer as a binary war, this engine identifies it as a **Signaling Failure**. We utilize the **BTNL9/Gamma Delta T-cell** axis as the "Ghost" node to re-introduce the switching logic necessary to collapse the tumor's narrative.
